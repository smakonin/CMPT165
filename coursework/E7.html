<p>
In this lab, you will exercise your skills with the four design principles discussed in Unit&nbsp;6 of the <a href="/CC/165/common/guide/"><cite>Study Guide</cite></a>.
</p>

<ol class="labsteps">
<li>
<p><del>
Review the solutions for exercise 6 in <a href="https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/">CourSys</a> (select your section and &ldquo;course pages&rdquo;).  Did you reach the same conclusions for the &#8220;correct&#8221; formats for each image?  If not, can you explain why?  [There's no need to report your answer here: just take a moment to understand the solutions and why yours may differ.]
</del></li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Create a simple web page</strong> with your answer to the following questions.
</p>
<p>
Have a look at the <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/"><abbr title="Simon Fraser University" class="obvious">SFU</abbr> Computing Science web page</a>.
</p>
<p>
For each of the four design principles (proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast), indicate what parts of the page (or the whole site design if you prefer) are both good and bad.  For the bad parts, do you have any suggestions about how they should be fixed?
</p>
</li>
<li>
Repeat the above for the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> front page.
</li>
<li>
Add a 2 to 3 sentence paragraph describing which site's design you liked best and why.
<del>
Add some comments on how these pages (and the rest of their sites) do with respect to the other page design ideas discussed in the <a href="/CC/165/common/guide/">Guide</a>: conventions, readability, overall page design.  Do you notice well-known web design conventions?  Can you easily scan the pages on the site for information you want?  Do individual pages on the site contain information on their context/position within the larger site?
</del></li>
</ol>

<p>
When you're done, upload the files from this lab to the course web server.  Submit the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of the page you created to <a href="https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/">CourSys</a>.
