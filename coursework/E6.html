In this question, you will be coming up with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="obvious">CSS</abbr> colour codes for some specified colours.  Of course, there are no unique correct answers.  Try to get the right colours by using what you know about working with three-character colour codes (like <code class="css">#f70</code>), not by looking up colours in a reference.
</p>
<p>
Start by saving the <a href="files/lab6-colours.html">sample colour <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language" class="obvious">XHTML</abbr> file</a> and the <a href="files/lab6-style.css">partial <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="obvious">CSS</abbr> file</a>.  <strong>Fill in the colours in the style sheet</strong> so the colours match the words.  For example, you'll probably want to change the style for the first colour block to this:
</p>
<div class="blockcode">
<code class="css">#a {
  background-color: #f00;
}</code>
</div>
</li>

For this question, you will need a bitmap image editing program.  If you have Photoshop, Photo Paint, or a similar program, you can use that.  If not, you can <a href="/CC/165/common/sw#graphics">download and install the <acronym title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</acronym></a> for free (see <a href="/CC/165/common/gimp">instructions for using <acronym title="GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</acronym></a>).  Microsoft Paint is not appropriate, since it doesn't support the formats you need to use for web work.
</p>
<p>
Start by saving two images: <a href="files/lab6-photo.jpg">this photograph</a>, and the <a href="files/lab6-logo.png">the <abbr title="Simon Fraser University" class="obvious">SFU</abbr> logo</a>. *
</p>
<p>
Open each in a photo editor.  Save each one with each of the common web graphics formats: <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format" class="obvious">GIF</abbr>, <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics" class="obvious">PNG</abbr>, and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group" class="obvious">JPEG</abbr>.  <strong>Compare the file size and quality</strong> of the resulting images. Some notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format" class="obvious">GIF</abbr> images can only handle 8-bit colour, so the image will have to be converted before saving.  You may want to try both a 24-bit and 8-bit <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics" class="obvious">PNG</abbr> image as well.</li>
  <li><abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group" class="obvious">JPEG</abbr> images cannot handle transparency, so the logo must be converted when saved.  Your image editor will probably deal with this for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Create an <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language" class="obvious">XHTML</abbr> page with a summary of what you found.  This doesn't have to be an essay or anything: just quickly indicate what was good and bad for each image.  Which one would you choose if you were putting that image on a web page?
</p>
<p>
Don't upload the images&mdash;they will just take up space on the server, and we already know what they look like.
</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>
When you're done, upload the files from this lab to the course web server.  Submit the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s of the pages you created to <a href="https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/">CourSys</a>.
