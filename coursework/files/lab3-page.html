<h1>A Page About Nothing</h1>

<p>
Nothing is the lack or absence of anything (including empty space). "Nothing"
and "zero" are closely related but not identical concepts. The term "nothing"
is rarely used mathematically, though it could be said that a set contains
nothing iff (if and only if) it is the empty set, in which case its cardinality
(or size) is zero. Nothing differs from zero in the way that zero is something,
a finite amount which is defined. While nothing overlaps the quantity zero, in
the way that it also is, when finitely defined, zero, it differs in the way that
it has no specific basis like zero does in numbers.

From a philosophical point of view, the concept of "nothing" can have many
interpretations. In fact, people can even state that nothing does not exist. One
cannot sense, see, feel, or think nothing. There is no contact with nothing.
Nothing is where everything isn't. Visualizing "nothing" would make "something".
It could be seen as a physical void or as just a word which only has meaning
when used to describe a relationship between different "somethings". A single
"correct" definition of nothing could be considered impossible, since "right"
and "wrong" do not fit within the confines of nothing.
